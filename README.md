*MooTouch is an all-in-one Mobile Web Application Framework that aims to power the future of mobile computing with 100% web technologies*

#MooTouch is:

- Fast
- Modular
- Highly extensible

#MooTouch consists of:

- An extremely modular JavaScript library built upon MooTools
- A collection of application themes that mimic the native look an feel of mobile devices

#MooTouchâ€™s spirits:

- Everything, from the main library to themes, are well structured and loosely-coupled so that users can either take the whole provided libraries to build full-blown applications immediately or just pick the pieces they need to do in their own ways
- The framework must support all popular touch-based mobile devices. Additional functionality in the future means extending, no re-factoring required. Targeted devices are iPhone / iPod Touch, iPad and Android (2.0+)
